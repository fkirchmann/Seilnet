A web app I developed to manage our residence hall: efficiently automates user, WiFi & firewall management, integrated with iptables & FreeRADIUS. Provides Single Sign-On for several other apps and a user self-service portal.

## TODO
- Document Features
- Add iptables scripts
- Dockerize the application
- Write instructions for quick deployment via docker-compose

If you're interested in using this application for your residence hall, please contact me!

## Technology Stack
- Java
- MySQL
- Liquibase
- Pebble Template Engine
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Can interface with iptables & FreeRADIUS' rlm_rest module
